# Mission

Is this your first time to a top conference? Have you ever wanted your own work recognized by this huge and active community? Do you encounter difficulties in polishing your ideas, experiments, paper writing, etc? Then, this session is exactly for you!

This year, we are organizing again (last year at NeurIPS) this special New In ML workshop, co-locating with ICML 2020. We invited top  researchers to share their experience in diverse research directions. Our biggest goal is to help you publish papers at top conferences (e.g. ICML, NeurIPS), and generally provide you with the guidance you need to contribute to ML research fully and effectively!  

# Important Dates

- July 13th, 2020: Session day


# Call For Papers

*Please note that for ICML2020, NewInML is not preparing a CFP. This is a CFP for NeurIPS 2020.*

Since this is an exercise in writing good NeurIPS papers, the authors are requested to submit papers respecting the NeurIPS format and instructions: [https://nips.cc/Conferences/2020/CallForPapers](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2020/CallForPapers). **The page limit is 8 pages + extra references, but shorter papers with enough good contents are welcome.** We restrict that submissions are **not under review or accepted elsewhere**. Papers having been rejected before should be revised before submission to New In ML. We recommend sharing previous reviews with your new reviewers.

All topics related to machine learning are welcome. They include but not limited to:
- Adversarial Machine Learning
- Automated Machine Learning
- Bayesian Machine Learning
- Causal Inference
- Deep Learning Theory
- Deep Learning Interpretability
- Fairness and Differential Privacy
- Graph Neural Networks
- Meta Learning
- Reinforcement Learning


Paper submission is through CMT platform: TBD

Accepted papers will be reviewed by expert NeurIPS reviewers and, if accepted, will get a talk or a poster at the workshop and expect coaching. <b> This will NOT count as an official NeurIPS publication, so papers submitted can then be revised and submitted to other venues like NeurIPS 2021, ICML 2021, but you should check the policy of other conferences if you want to re-submit elsewhere.</b>
