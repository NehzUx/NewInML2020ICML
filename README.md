# Mission

Is this your first time to a top conference? Have you ever wanted your own work recognized by this huge and active community? Do you encounter difficulties in polishing your ideas, experiments, paper writing, etc? Then, this session is exactly for you!

This year, we are organizing this special New in ML workshop, co-locating with NeurIPS 2019. We are targeting anyone who has not published a paper at the NeurIPS main conference yet. We invited top NeurIPS researchers to review your work and share with you their experience in poster sessions and mentoring sessions. The best papers will get oral presentations and even awards!

Our biggest goal is to help you publish papers at next year's NeurIPS conference, and generally provide you with the guidance you need to contribute to ML research fully and effectively!  

# Important Dates

- October 15th, 2019 (Anywhere on Earth): Paper submission deadline
- November 8th, 2019: Author notification deadline
- December 9th, 2019: Session day

Within quota limits, the authors of the best accepted papers will be receiving the possibility of registering to NeurIPS and will be able to apply for travel awards, to be attributed according to merit and need.
