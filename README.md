# Mission

Is this your first time to a top conference? Have you ever wanted your own work recognized by this huge and active community? Do you encounter difficulties in polishing your ideas, experiments, paper writing, etc? Then, this session is exactly for you!

This year, we are organizing again (last year at NeurIPS) this special New In ML workshop, co-locating with ICML 2020. We invited top  researchers to share their experience in diverse research directions. Our biggest goal is to help you publish papers at top conferences (e.g. ICML, NeurIPS), and generally provide you with the guidance you need to contribute to ML research fully and effectively!
